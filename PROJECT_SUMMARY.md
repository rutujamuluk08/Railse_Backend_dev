## Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Task Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks
   - Assign tasks to staff members
   - Track task status (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
   - Manage task priorities (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

2. **Staff Management**
   - View all staff members
   - Get staff details by ID
   - Staff information includes name, email, and role

3. **Task Assignment**
   - Assign tasks to specific staff members
   - Reassign tasks by customer reference
   - Track task ownership and responsibility

### Bug Fixes Implemented

#### Bug Fix 1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates
**Problem**: When reassigning a task by customer reference, the old task wasn't being removed, creating duplicates.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `assignTaskByReference` method in `TaskService`
- Automatically cancels all existing active tasks for the same customer reference
- Creates a new task with the same details but assigned to the new staff member
- Logs the reassignment activity for audit purposes

**Code Location**: `TaskService.assignTaskByReference()`

#### Bug Fix 2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View
**Problem**: Cancelled tasks were appearing in task listings, cluttering the view for operations employees.

**Solution**:
- Modified all task filtering methods to exclude CANCELLED tasks
- Updated `getTasksByDateRange`, `getTasksByStaff`, and `getTasksByPriority` methods
- Ensures only relevant tasks are shown to users

**Code Location**: `TaskService.getTasksByDateRange()`, `getTasksByStaff()`, `getTasksByPriority()`

### New Features Implemented

#### Feature 1: Smart Daily Task View
**Requirement**: Enhanced date-based task fetching that shows everything an employee needs to act on.

**Implementation**:
- Returns tasks that started within the specified date range
- Also returns active tasks that started before the range but are still open and not completed
- Provides a comprehensive "today's work" view for operations employees

**Code Location**: `TaskService.getTasksByDateRange()`

#### Feature 2: Task Priority Management
**Requirement**: Set and change task priorities so teams know what to focus on.

**Implementation**:
- Added `TaskPriority` enum with HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW values
- Created `UpdateTaskPriorityRequest` DTO for priority updates
- Implemented `PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}/priority` endpoint
- Added `GET /api/tasks/priority/{priority}` endpoint for filtering
- Priority changes are logged in activity history

**Code Location**: 
- `TaskPriority.java`
- `UpdateTaskPriorityRequest.java`
- `TaskController.updateTaskPriority()`
- `TaskController.getTasksByPriority()`

#### Feature 3: Task Comments & Activity History
**Requirement**: Full history of task activities and user comments for team collaboration.

**Implementation**:
- Added `TaskActivity` and `TaskComment` model classes
- Implemented automatic activity logging for all task operations
- Created `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/comments` endpoint for adding comments
- Enhanced task details to include complete activity history and comments
- All activities are timestamped and include performer information

**Code Location**:
- `TaskActivity.java`, `TaskComment.java`
- `TaskController.addComment()`
- `Task.addActivity()`, `Task.addComment()`

## API Endpoints

### Task Endpoints
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}` - Get task by ID
- `GET /api/tasks/date-range` - Get tasks by date range (Smart Daily View)
- `GET /api/tasks/staff/{staffId}` - Get tasks by staff member
- `GET /api/tasks/priority/{priority}` - Get tasks by priority
- `POST /api/tasks/assign-by-ref` - Reassign task by customer reference
- `PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}/priority` - Update task priority
- `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/comments` - Add comment to task
- `PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}/complete` - Mark task as completed
- `PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}/cancel` - Cancel task

### Staff Endpoints
- `GET /api/staff` - Get all staff members
- `GET /api/staff/{staffId}` - Get staff by ID

## Sample Data
The application comes pre-loaded with sample data:
- **Staff**: John Doe (Sales), Jane Smith (Operations), Bob Wilson (Sales)
- **Tasks**: Customer Follow-up (HIGH priority), Inventory Check (MEDIUM priority)

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validation errors for request bodies
- Resource not found errors
- Global exception handler for consistent error responses

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the application: `gradlew.bat bootRun`
2. Test endpoints using Postman, Insomnia, or cURL
3. Verify bug fixes by testing task reassignment and filtering
4. Test new features by creating tasks, updating priorities, and adding comments

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **In-memory Storage**: Used Java collections for simplicity and demonstration purposes
2. **MapStruct**: Implemented for clean object mapping between entities and DTOs
3. **Lombok**: Used to reduce boilerplate code in model classes
4. **RESTful Design**: Followed REST conventions for API endpoints
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: All activities are logged for audit purposes
6. **Validation**: Input validation using Jakarta validation annotations

## Professional Practices Demonstrated
1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with controller, service, and model layers
2. **DTO Pattern**: Proper data transfer objects for API requests/responses
3. **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler with meaningful error messages
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline code documentation
5. **Testing**: Basic test structure included
6. **Build Configuration**: Proper Gradle configuration with all necessary dependencies
