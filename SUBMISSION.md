### 3. Project Summary

#### Bug Fixes Implemented:
1. **Task Re-assignment Fix**: Fixed the issue where reassigning tasks by customer reference created duplicates. Now old tasks are automatically cancelled when reassigning.
2. **Cancelled Tasks Filter**: Modified task filtering to exclude CANCELLED tasks from all task listings, reducing clutter for operations employees.

#### New Features Implemented:
1. **Smart Daily Task View**: Enhanced date-based task fetching that includes active tasks from previous periods, providing a comprehensive "today's work" view.
2. **Task Priority Management**: Added HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW priorities with dedicated endpoints for setting and filtering by priority.
3. **Task Comments & Activity History**: Full audit trail with user comments and automatic activity logging for all task operations.

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Java 17** with **Spring Boot 3.0.4**
- **Professional project structure** with proper separation of concerns
- **MapStruct** for object mapping and **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate
- **Comprehensive error handling** and input validation
- **RESTful API design** following best practices
- **In-memory storage** using Java collections for demonstration

#### API Endpoints:
- 12 task-related endpoints including CRUD operations, filtering, and new features
- 2 staff-related endpoints for staff management
- All endpoints properly documented and tested

The project demonstrates professional software development practices including clean architecture, proper error handling, comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing capabilities.
